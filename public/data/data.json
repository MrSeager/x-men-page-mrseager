But she was unafraid to call Wolverine names, insult him, yell at him, argue with him or threaten to get into a fight; with him; whenever he annoyed her or; made her angry. The fact that; she possessed invulnerability as one of her powers more than likely was a factor in this; she knew he could not hurt her, so she could get away with stuff other people could not. \n\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Despite Rogue being heroic; she can sometimes be headstrong, short-tempered, hot-headed and selfish; but will always do the right thing in the end. \n\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0In X-Men '97, Rogue's old romantic feelings towards Magneto has been rekindled, after he became the new leader of the X-Men, leaving Gambit in the dust.
